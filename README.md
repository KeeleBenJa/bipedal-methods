supplementary code for "Deep Neuroevolution of Humanoids that Walk Further and Faster with Robust Gaits"

The folder "deep-neuroevolution" contains a modified version of the code featured on the UberAI github for deep-neuroevolved humanoid walking.

Also included are modified files from the OpenAI gym github ("other" folder). These include xml files (located in gym/envs/mujoco/assets) for the default and rough ground environments, as well as a modified humanoid.py (located in gym/envs/mujoco) for the changes to the humanoid environment to enable the methods employed.
